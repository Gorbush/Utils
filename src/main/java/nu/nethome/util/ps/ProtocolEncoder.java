     * To get a complete message, the user of this interface must first call the encode message with phase set to
     * FIRST and then call the encode method with phase set to REPEATED and then concatenate the results and repeat the
     * result from REPEATED the required number of times. The helper class {@link MessageRepeater} can do just that.
